Brief notes on the 8 topics given
1. Classes:
JavaScript classes are a means of creating blueprints for objects that let you deinfe properties and methods that multiple objects can share. A class normally has a constructor(special function that runs when you create a new object from the class). The objects are called instances. It is in the constructor that you set up the initial values of the object.
2. Arrow Functions:
Arrow Functions are a shorter and more compact way of defining functions. They make use of a special arrow(=>) instead of the traditional "function" keyword and they can return values without using the "return" keyword. They are useful for quick, one-line functions.
3. Variables:
Variables are words used to store data values(numbers, test and objects) and can be referenced and manipulated in a program. There are 3 main ways of declaring variables in JavaScript wich ar "var", "let" and "const".
4. Array Methods:
Array Methods are built-in functions that allow you to manipulate arrays easily, that is, adding, removing, searching or transforming elements.
5. Destructuring:
Destructuring is a way to unpack values from arrays or properties form objects into dinstinct variables.
6. Modules:
Mdoules are files that contain code that you can reuse in other files.
7. Ternary Operator:
A ternary operator is a shortcut for an if...else statement that takes 3 operands. The syntax goes as follows: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
8. Spread Operator:
The spread operator (. . .) is used to expand the content of arrays, objects and iterable values. It is used for merging, copying and passing values easily without writing loops.
